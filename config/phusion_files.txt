Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:

   LoadModule passenger_module /Users/smythe1/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/gems/passenger-4.0.41/buildout/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   <IfModule mod_passenger.c>
     PassengerRoot /Users/smythe1/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/gems/passenger-4.0.41
     PassengerDefaultRuby /usr/local/Cellar/ruby20/2.0.0-p451/bin/ruby
   </IfModule>

After you restart Apache, you are ready to deploy any number of web
applications on Apache, with a minimum amount of configuration!

Press ENTER to continue.

Deploying a web application: an example

Suppose you have a web application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    
      <Directory /somewhere/public>
         # This relaxes Apache security settings.
         AllowOverride all
         # MultiViews must be turned off.
         Options -MultiViews
      </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>

And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
optimization tips, troubleshooting and other useful information:
